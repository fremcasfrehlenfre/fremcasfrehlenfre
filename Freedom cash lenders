Direct Subsidized: A federal loan for undergraduate students. You don’t get charged interest while you’re in school. It is need-based, so whether you qualify depends on your FAFSA information.
Direct Unsubsidized: A federal loan that any undergraduate or graduate student can get (as long as you haven’t reached your lifetime borrowing limit). You are charged interest while you are in school. To cut costs, pay the interest as you go.
Direct PLUS: Federal loans for the parents of undergraduate students, or for graduate and professional students. You must pass a credit check to get these loans.
Private: Loans offered by banks or credit unions. You should shop around for the best offer you can find. Students generally need a parent or other family member to co-sign.

Depending on where you live and other factors, you may have other options. Some states provide low-cost education loans for residents. There are also nonprofits and other organizations that offer low-or zero-interest student loans, often within a specific city or state.
